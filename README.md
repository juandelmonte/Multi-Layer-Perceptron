# Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)

As a data science enthusiast, I’ve added a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to my portfolio. This model, built using the numpy library, is a type of Artificial Neural Network with wide applications in machine learning and AI. MLPs are unique in their ability to make accurate predictions and identify data patterns, enhancing our analytical capabilities.

The creation of this MLP code was driven by my desire to understand the core principles of Artificial Neural Networks, such as backpropagation, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and statistical model evaluation methods. I’ve applied this MLPs to solve classical complex classification and regression machine learning problems like handwriting recognition, yacht design resistance prediction, and bank fraud detection using autoencoders. It could also be used for real world applications but it was not the intention nor ot has the advanced capabilities of other public available models.

Working with MLPs has been a thrilling journey, and I’m eager to share this code in my portfolio. If you’re up for a challenge, let’s explore the world of ML together!
